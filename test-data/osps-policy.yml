title: "My Security Policy"
purpose: |
  This policy tailors the high baseline security policy with additional controls for
  supply chain security (NIST 800-161) and open source project security (OSPS Baseline).
  It is designed for systems requiring enhanced security posture including supply chain
  risk management and open source component security.

          text: |
            When a user attempts to access a sensitive resource in the project's
            version control system, the system MUST require the user to complete
            a multi-factor authentication process. SMS-based MFA (including SMS text
            messages and voice calls) MUST NOT be used.
          applicability: ["Maturity Level 1", "Maturity Level 2", "Maturity Level 3"]
          recommendation: |
            Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version
            control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
            authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
            settings. Passkeys, hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn), and
            time-based one-time password (TOTP) authenticator apps are acceptable
            for this control. SMS-based MFA MUST NOT be used.

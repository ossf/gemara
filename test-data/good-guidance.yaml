guidelines:
  - id: GUID-VULN-001
    family: VULN-MGMT
    title: Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment
    objective: Establish and maintain a vulnerability scanning program to identify security vulnerabilities in systems and applications on a regular basis.
    statements:
      - id: GUID-VULN-001.1
        title: Scanning Coverage
        text: Conduct vulnerability scans at regular intervals and ensure comprehensive coverage of all systems.
        recommendations:
          - Ensure all systems, applications, and network infrastructure are included in scanning activities
          - Automate scanning processes where possible to ensure consistency and reduce manual effort
      - id: GUID-VULN-001.2
        title: Vulnerability Prioritization and Remediation
        text: Prioritize identified vulnerabilities based on risk and establish remediation timelines.
        recommendations:
          - Classify vulnerabilities based on CVSS scores or similar risk rating systems
          - Consider the business criticality of affected systems when prioritizing remediation
          - Establish clear timelines for remediation based on severity

    title: Enhanced Vulnerability Scanning for Critical Systems
    objective: Extended vulnerability scanning requirements for critical systems requiring more frequent scanning.
    extends:
      entry-id: GUID-VULN-001
    statements:
      - id: GUID-VULN-001-ENH.1
        title: Critical System Scanning
        text: Implement enhanced scanning frequency and depth for critical systems.
        recommendations:
          - Perform scans continuously for critical systems
          - Include authenticated scans to identify configuration vulnerabilities
          - Prioritize critical system vulnerabilities for immediate remediation

    title: Automated Vulnerability Remediation
    objective: Implement automated remediation capabilities for standard vulnerabilities.
    extends:
      entry-id: GUID-VULN-001-ENH
    statements:
      - id: GUID-VULN-001-ENH-2.1
        title: Automation Implementation
        text: Deploy automated tools for vulnerability remediation where appropriate.
        recommendations:
          - Automate patch deployment for low-risk vulnerabilities
          - Implement automated rollback capabilities for failed patches
          - Monitor automated remediation activities for effectiveness

    title: Cloud Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment
    objective: Extended vulnerability scanning requirements for cloud environments.
    extends:
      reference-id: NIST-800-53
      entry-id: RA-5
    statements:
      - id: GUID-VULN-EXT-RA-5.1
        title: Cloud-Native Scanning Tools
        text: Leverage cloud provider security services and third-party cloud security platforms for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
        recommendations:
          - Use cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools to identify misconfigurations and compliance gaps
          - Implement container security scanning for containerized workloads and Kubernetes clusters
          - Scan infrastructure-as-code templates for security vulnerabilities before deployment

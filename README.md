# Gemara: GRC Engineering Model for Automated Risk Assessment  [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gemaraproj/gemara.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gemaraproj/gemara)

> Pronounced: Juh-MAH-ruh (think :gem:)

**Gemara** is a standardized, machine-readable data model designed to bridge the gap between high-level compliance requirements and low-level technical evidence. By providing a structured schema (powered by [CUE](https://cuelang.org/)), Gemara enables automated risk assessment, consistent reporting, and interoperability across the security toolchain.

## Resources

1. View the model and supporting resources at [gemara.openssf.org](https://gemara.openssf.org)
2. Find schemas in this repository, or in the CUE central registry.
  - Use the schemas directly with [cue](https://cuelang.org/) for validating Gemara data payloads against the schemas and more.
3. Use the Go SDK to integrate Gemara schemas into your automated tools
  - `github.com/gemaraproj/go-gemara` and consult our [go docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gemaraproj/go-gemara)

## Ecosystem Map

Gemara is supported by a wide range of official SDKs (Go, Python), CLI tools, AI integrations, and GitHub Actions.

title: The Gemara Model

**Status**: <span class="badge badge-stable">Stable</span>

The Gemara Model describes six categorical layers of GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) activities, representing how GRC activities are organized and interact.

## The Six Layers

Gemara organizes compliance activities into six categorical layers, each building upon the previous:

## Model Stability

This model is intentionally stable. Changes are rare and require significant community discussion, as the model reflects fundamental organizational patterns in GRC activities.

**Why Stability Matters:**
- Provides a consistent foundation for all Gemara work
- Allows the Lexicon and Implementation to evolve independently
- Ensures long-term compatibility

## Relationship to Other Components

### [The Lexicon](../lexicon)
Provides definitions for terms used within each layer. The Model describes structure; the Lexicon provides shared vocabulary.

### [The Implementation](../implementation)
Provides schemas and SDK libraries based on the Model. The Model describes conceptual layers; the Implementation provides machine-readable formats and APIs.

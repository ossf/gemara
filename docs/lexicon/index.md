title: The Gemara Lexicon
---

**Status**: <span class="badge badge-evolving">Evolving</span>


While the **[Model](../model)** describes the structure and relationships of GRC activities, the Lexicon provides the vocabulary. It establishes term meanings within the Gemara context, ensuring consistent definitions when teams discuss "controls," "evaluations," or "policies."

The Lexicon helps teams:
- **Agree on terminology** across activities and teams
- **Communicate effectively** across organizational boundaries
- **Understand relationships** between concepts in the Model

## Contributing

The Lexicon evolves based on community needs:

- **Term needs clarification?** Open an issue or discussion
- **Propose a new definition?** Submit a PR
- **Found an inconsistency?** Report it

See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ossf/gemara/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### [The Model](../model)

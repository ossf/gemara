title: The Gemara Lexicon
---

**Status**: <span class="badge badge-evolving">Evolving</span>

## Overview

The Lexicon helps teams:
- **Agree on terminology** across different activities and teams
- **Communicate effectively** across organizational boundaries
- **Understand relationships** between concepts in the Model

## Purpose

While the **[Model](../model)** describes the structure and relationships of GRC activities, 
the Lexicon provides the vocabulary. It establishes what terms mean within the Gemara context, 
ensuring that when teams discuss "controls," "evaluations," or "policies," they're using 
consistent definitions.

## Contributing Definitions

The Lexicon evolves based on community needs. If you:

- **Find a term that needs clarification**: Open an issue or discussion
- **Want to propose a new definition**: Submit a PR with your proposed definition
- **See an inconsistency**: Help us improve by reporting it

See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ossf/gemara/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to propose changes.

## Relationship to Other Components

As one of Gemara's three core components, the Lexicon works alongside:

### [The Model Component](../model)
The Model component provides the structural framework that the Lexicon 
defines terms for. Terms are organized by their relationship to the Model's layers.

### [The Implementation Component](../implementation)
The Implementation component uses Lexicon definitions to inform 
schema design and SDK documentation. When working with the Implementation, refer to the 
Lexicon for precise term meanings.

Together, these three components support the entire Gemara ecosystem.

## Using the Lexicon

### For GRC Professionals
Use the Lexicon to ensure your team is using consistent terminology when discussing compliance 
activities. Reference specific definitions in documentation and discussions.

### For Developers
When working with the Implementation, refer to the Lexicon to understand the precise meaning 
of terms used in schemas and APIs.
